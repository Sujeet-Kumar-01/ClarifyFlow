## 🚨 Problem Statement: Legal Tech Jargon (Access to Justice)

Most people blindly accept Terms of Service, rental agreements, or contracts without reading them because they are:
- Written in complex legal language (legalese)
- Extremely long and difficult to understand
- Not available in local languages

This results in people unknowingly signing away their **rights, privacy, and money**.
